I have a project for a connected object, do you think you can give me a quote on this project? I have to hand it in on the 21st of April, Thanks in advance for your answer Connected wine cellar project: First of all, the alcohol sensor (Alcohol Sensor v1.2) checks the blood alcohol level of the user who wants to open the wine cellar by taking a measurement through his breath. The data collected by the alcohol sensor is transmitted to the Raspberry Pi 3b via the Grove PI +. If the blood alcohol level is below a certain predefined threshold, the win an RFID reader. If the digital card matches the one stored in the system, the wine cellar door opens. If not, it remains locked. Meanwhile, the temperature sensor (Grove DHT11) measures the temperature inside the wine cellar. The data collected by the temperature sensor is also transmitted to the Raspberry Pi 3b via the Grove PI +. If the temperature inside the wine cellar is within the desired temperature range, the green light will illuminate and a confirmation message will appear on the LED display. If the temperature is too high, the red light comes on and a warning message appears on the LED display. If the temperature is too low, the blue light comes on and an alert message is also displayed on the LED screen. Sensors we have: Raspberry PI 3b, Grove PI +, Grove red LED, Grove blue LED, Grove green LED, Raspberry PI 5V 2A power supply, Grove DHT11: temperature and humidity sensor, Grove alcohol sensor v1.2, RFID reader.
